    Problem: 
    Companies receive large volumes of customer feedback from multiple sources, but this data is unstructured and difficult to analyze. Product teams must manually review, categorize, and convert feedback into requirements, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often leads to missed insights and delayed product improvements.

    Solution: 
    Automatically transforms raw customer feedback into structured product requirements. It analyzes feedback, identifies key issues, generates validated requirements, and converts them into engineering-ready tasks, enabling faster and more data-driven product decision-making.

    title: "PathBound",
    description: `
    Problem:
    Traditional currency exchange and remittance systems expose users to unpredictable exchange rates and hidden fees. In volatile markets, users often receive significantly less than expected, with little transparency or control over the conversion rate. Additionally, there is no mechanism to set conditions like minimum acceptable rates or timing, leaving users dependent on centralized intermediaries.

    Solution:
    PathBound addresses this by enabling rate-protected exchange intents using blockchain-based path payments. Users can define a minimum acceptable exchange rate and a valid time window for execution, ensuring better control and predictability. Funds remain secure under user custody until execution, and transactions are processed atomically, guaranteeing that exchanges either complete fully at the desired rate or not at all.`,

    Problem:
    Traditional code collaboration relies on version control systems that are not truly real-time, leading to delays, merge conflicts, and inefficient teamwork. Developers often struggle with tracking changes, coordinating edits, and maintaining consistency when multiple people work on the same file simultaneously.

    Solution:
    CodeSync solves this by providing a real-time collaborative coding environment where multiple developers can edit code simultaneously with instant synchronization. Features like live cursors, user presence, and conflict-free editing using CRDTs ensure smooth collaboration. With built-in syntax highlighting and independent undo/redo history, it creates a seamless and efficient coding experience for teams working together from anywhere.`,

    Problem:
    Identifying bugs and code issues in JavaScript often relies on executing the code or manual reviews, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Many developers miss structural or logical issues early in development, leading to inefficient debugging and reduced code quality. Additionally, existing tools can be complex or lack immediate, visual feedback during coding.

    Solution:
    VeriJS addresses this by providing a lightweight static analysis tool that detects issues without running the code. By parsing code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and applying rule-based analysis, it identifies potential bugs and bad practices in real time. With an interactive editor and instant visual feedback, developers can quickly understand and fix issues, improving code quality and development efficiency`,

    Problem:
    Manually assigning tasks to engineers is time-consuming and often inefficient, especially in teams with varying skill sets and workloads. It can lead to poor resource utilization, missed deadlines, and mismatches between task requirements and engineer capabilities.

    Solution:
    Zenith automates task allocation by intelligently matching tasks with the most suitable resources based on skills, availability, priority, and deadlines. By dynamically evaluating capacity and requirements, it ensures optimal workload distribution, improves efficiency, and helps teams deliver work faster and more effectively.`,

    Problem:
    Finding nearby resources like hospitals, restaurants, or services in real-time can be inefficient due to fragmented data sources and lack of intuitive visualization. Traditional systems often fail to provide accurate location-based results, dynamic filtering, and seamless interaction on maps, leading to a poor user experience.

    Solution:
    GeoFinder addresses this by offering a WebGIS-based platform that integrates geolocation, geocoding, and real-time spatial queries. It enables users to search and visualize nearby resources on an interactive map with accurate distance calculations, live suggestions, and dynamic clustering. This ensures fast, intuitive, and location-aware discovery of relevant places.`,

Existing digital solutions often struggle to balance privacy, verifiability, and resistance to tampering, making large-scale secure online voting difficult to implement.

    Solution:
    ECI Secure Vote addresses this by providing a secure, remote voting platform powered by advanced cryptography, AI-based security, and blockchain verification. It ensures voter authentication through biometrics, maintains anonymity using zero-knowledge principles, and guarantees tamper-proof, verifiable results. With real-time monitoring and anti-coercion mechanisms, the system enables safe, transparent, and accessible voting from anywhere in the world.`,
